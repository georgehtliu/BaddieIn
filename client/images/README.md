# Profile Images

Place your profile images in this folder with the following names:

- `profile1.jpg` through `profile14.jpg` - Profile pictures for the fake professional profiles
- `all-done.jpg` - Optional image for the final "All Done!" card

**Image Requirements:**
- Recommended size: 400x600 pixels (portrait orientation)
- Format: JPG, PNG, or any web-compatible image format

**Quick Solution:**
You can use placeholder images from services like:
- https://via.placeholder.com/400x600
- Or download stock photos from sites like Unsplash, Pexels, etc.

The app will work even without images (they just won't display), but adding images will make it look much better!
